            Thinking about us, you know what I mean,
            <br />
            Try to understand, what could have been,
            <br />
            Hoping deep inside, not to make a scene,
            <br />
            Together <mark>[...together]</mark>
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine a day,
            <br />
            When your little hand, continues to mine,
            <br />
            Where the troubled souls, brightly shine,{' '}
            <mark className='text-nowrap'>[...so brightly shine]</mark>
            <br />
            My treasure.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b className='text-white'>CHORUS:</b>
            <br />
            One too many times, not now.
            <br />
            Be in other lives, just how. <br />
            You had given up, that vow. <mark>[...oh oh]</mark>
            <br />
            Bit from you that moment dies, and so.
            <br />
            Listen longingly to her eyes, say no.
            <br />
            Dream of crushing nights, below.{' '}
            <mark className='text-nowrap'>[...deep down below]</mark>
          </p>
          <p>
            Love should never come,
            <br />
            It is not a game, with stakes up high,{' '}
            <mark className='text-nowrap'>[...really high]</mark>
            <br />
            Rules must be followed, and the years go by,
            <br />
            No pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I keep asking what if,
            <br />
            As your feeling rots, each day slowly,
            <br />
            Might&apos;ve been perfect, almost holy,
            <br />
            Forever.
