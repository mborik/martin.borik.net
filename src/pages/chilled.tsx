        <h2>Chilled</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve been creating the composition since about the end of 2004.
          It is genrically diverse and thematically colorful. The 40+ minute
          composition is composed of eight movements, focusing on the emotional
          side of the music rather than the simple entertainment form. I will be
          happy for any listener who finds this music engaging and moving, and
          I&apos;ll be even happier if he or she identifies with the emotions
          I&apos;ve put into the music.
        </p>

          The piece is a musical storyline dedicated to the four basic Earth
          elements and the two space ones. These elements are accompanied by
          motifs that evoke something in me. Dreamy newage motifs are alternated
          with jazz-rock elements, in the same way that acoustic instruments are
          alternated with synthetic ones. The backbone of this composition is
          the varying tempo with a combination of unusual time signatures and
          rhythms...

              <time>00:00</time> - <b>well come</b>
            </mark>
            <br />
            The first, opening movement was accompanied by my inner anxiety. The
            orchestral arrangements are soon replaced by a minimalist atmosphere
            in 7/8 time signature and strong tense piano solos.

            </mark>
            <br />
            The second movement, wrapped melancholy and emotions that used to
            burn us. After a balladic guitar opening, the motif breaks into a
            5/4 time signature in a jazz-rock atmosphere that climaxes towards
            the end, to finally fade away in a dissonant piano.

            </mark>
            <br />
            The third movement, which (in contrast to the previous ones) is full
            of tranquility. Initially swaying on waves of 7/4 time signature and
            softly hammering piano, but later sinking into a synthetic waltzing
            anthemic ode.

            </mark>
            <br />
            At first a purely orchestral piece with Gregorian chants, later on
            with ethno percussion, downtempo drums and a closing climax with a
            guitar solo.

              <time>22:32</time> - <b>wind</b>
            </mark>
            <br />A more mellow movement focusing mostly on guitars of various
            kinds, irregular beats and hidden melancholy.

          <li>
            <mark>

            </mark>
            <br />
            Grand finale! We&apos;ll return to the main motif from the beginning
            of Chilled, but in an upbeat mood that gradually builds up to the
            blissful climax.

            </mark>
            <br />
            Soothing and atmospheric, a synth-piano piece with a subtle ambient
            beat layered with burning pads.

            During my composing process, I&apos;ve teamed up with the indie
            music producer Michal &quot;Vulture&quot; Å up. I discovered the
            &quot;discarded&quot; motif in his archive and with his permission I
            used it as a backing track for introducing melancholic part. Later
            on, I teamed up with my good friend Pavel Kappler, who found a
            fitting vocalist and recorded her lead vocal on lyrics Maggie
            Kubova. In the second half of the track I moved away from this
            motif, breaking it into a 7/4 time signature and a jazz-rock club
            atmosphere.

          The bonus part of the album consists of 3 separate tracks of
          contemporary genres, designed to evoke the moods of everyday life,
          wrapped in appropriate ambient sounds. These tracks are ranging in
          style from dreamy chillout (with vocal improvisation), or soft-house
          that gradually breaks and becomes ambient, and the last track is pure
          00&apos;s downtempo.
